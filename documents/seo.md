Importance of SEO and analytics.

Search engines use a crawler to find keywords (associated with the search prompt) in your website. More matches in common will put you higher in the search results. This is very import for marketers. H tags are main source for keyword and importance search. If things like multiple H1 tags show up, they will hurt your search score. Ghost text is another example an attempt to trick the crawler that will reslut in a worse search score. Links to otherwebsite can improve if all sites are high quality. Analytics and heatmaps can asist by giving data that shows how users interact with your site. Where people hover, what they click, and when they leave your site can all be informative in making changes to increase your SEO score.
